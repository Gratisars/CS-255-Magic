#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?#
//The purpose of the Client/Owner DriverPass program is to improve students' readiness for driving exams by providing them with the opportunity to participate in behind-the-wheel instruction and providing them with access to online practice tests that replicate real-world driving conditions. One of their requirements was that the system be capable of ensuring that the location in question is in possession of the most recent version of the training and rules that are in line with the local DMV.//

#What did you do particularly well?#
//I believe that I performed rather well in the diagram designing part of the project as a whole, despite the I may have not included all of the user needs that other have but, feel the system will excute well.//

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?#
//Mentioning of possibly missing some of the user needs. Perhaps appplying alittle more detail to each of the functions to give the report more information.//

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
//During the development process of the project, we corresponed the owner DriverPass. We incorporated all of the functions that they laid out into the system's design. First phase is important to listen to the user's needs when designing a system because they are the ones who determine whether the system is a success.//

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?#
//In the designing of the DriverPass system, I found out how important it is having a strong foundation for development. This helps to provide a clear path for tasks and end goal for a system's development. Knowing what the system should do makes the development stage easier to begin, to design, and how it will be accomplished.//
